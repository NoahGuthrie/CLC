# CLC
This is a Command Line Calculator capable of performing binary or unary operations, defining variables, and assigning them values, performing operations with said variables, as well as accessing or erasing memory.
Running the code causes a menu to show up, asking which option you are interested in choosing. After the completion of each task, you will continue to be asked for your next option until you choose to exit. Additionally, following each operation each result will be assigned to a new position in an array and be kept as memory.
